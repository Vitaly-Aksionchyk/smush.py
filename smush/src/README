smush.py - Optimise images for the web
========================================

Smush.it is a great service that applies lossless optimisations to images for display on the web. Unfortunately
they don't provide an API at the time of writing, and sometimes it's convenient to have a local tool...

smush.py uses the same tools as Smush.it (read more at:
http://oreilly.com/server-administration/excerpts/9780596522315/optimizing-images.html), but can be run
locally.

The following software is required:

  * Gifsicle - http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/
  * ImageMagick
  * pngnq - http://pngnq.sourceforge.net/
  * pngcrush - http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/
